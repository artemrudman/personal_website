          <h2>A Historic Move</h2>
          <p>
            On March 18, 2025, Alphabet Inc.—Google's parent company—announced a
            definitive all-cash agreement to acquire Wiz, a rapidly scaling
            cloud-security startup, for a staggering $32 billion, marking the
            largest acquisition in Google's history . This acquisition not only
            surpasses prior deals like Motorola Mobility in 2012, but also
            outshines Google’s 2022 purchase of Mandiant for $5.4 billion  . <br />
          </p>
          <h2>Why Wiz? Why Now?</h2>
          <p>
            Wiz, founded in January 2020 by Israeli entrepreneurs Assaf
            Rappaport, Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik, and Ami Luttwak, rapidly rose
            to prominence with its innovative cloud-native application
            protection platform (CNAPP), capable of analyzing infrastructure
            across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Kubernetes
            environment. In just 18 months, Wiz soared from $1 million to $100 million in annual
            recurring revenue—one of the fastest growth rates in SaaS history
            Wikipedia . By 2024, it had reached about $350 million ARR, serving
            nearly 45 percent of Fortune 100 companies. Google aims to harness Wiz’s multicloud capabilities
            to bolster its cloud security suite—particularly vital as
            organizations increasingly adopt AI-infused, multicloud
            infrastructures. The goal: a unified, scalable, and more affordable
            security platform spanning Google Cloud and beyond<br />
